# GeneMatrix
Dear Users,

The files present here are GeneMatrix files for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly).
Currently, Drosophila_KEGG.gmt and Drosophila_REACTOME.gmt are available.
The gene sets were produced based on KEGG or REACTOME databases on June 4th 2021.

A workable SampleData.tsv is also provided.

For more details, please find our paper on PLOS ONE (UPDATE DOI here after acceptance).
